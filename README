| Trans-Lux J2  | AVR168      | Purpose            |
| ------------- |-------------|--------------------|
| pin 1         | pin 2       | clock              |
| pin 3         | pin 3       | data               |
| pin 6         | pin 4       | enable (high==off) |

The `trans_lux.sch` is an eagle file of a portion of the board. By no means is it accurate or complete. 
It was used only to determine the which pins were clock, data, and enable.
